# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage releases.
If you are making a change that should be included in the release notes, you must add a changeset.

To add a changeset, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

You will be prompted to select the packages that have been changed, the type of change (major, minor, or patch), and to provide a description of the change.
